Compilation was tested in Visual Studio 2019.
This version does not use the original drum sounds from Cave Story._

This is not use MIDI device.  
This original library was created by [Studio Pixel](http://studiopixel.sakura.ne.jp/) from 1999, and was used in 'Cave Story'.

## &#x1F352; Introduction

For the '[STARGAZER](http://www5b.biglobe.ne.jp/~kiss-me/aji/star/)' development, I inherited this library from [Studio Pixel](http://studiopixel.sakura.ne.jp/) in 2003.  
However, due to a change in my private life, it became inactive for a long time. On the other hand, the world expansion of 'Cave Story' has increased the number of people requesting Organya.

-----

In 1999, [Studio Pixel](http://studiopixel.sakura.ne.jp/) produced the song composition software Organya for "Cave Story".
>Basically, it is a tool used in the studio, so it is not very common. However, in rare cases, there is a person who says "I like shabby sound for whatever reason" and if they want to compose with it, this is the perfect tool.

With the world knowing the development of "Cave Story", which increased the demand of Organya, and the same for the opinion for how to manage the source code, I have made the repository public.

1999年に[開発室Pixel](http://studiopixel.sakura.ne.jp/)にて制作、後に「洞窟物語」にて使用されたオルガーニャ音源の作曲ソフトです。  
>基本的には開発室内で使うツールなので、あまり一般的とは言えませんが、まれに｢なぜかショボイ音が好き｣と言う人がいて、更に｢その音で作曲したい｣というのならこのツールはウッテツケです☆  

ご存知「洞窟物語」の世界展開により、その音源であるオルガーニャへの要望が増えた一方で、長期にわたり手つかずとなってしまったソースコードをいい加減何とかしろという声も同様に世界からチラホラと舞い込んできたのでリポジトリを公開することとしました。

# &#x1F34E; Contributing
This project was developed in Japanese. The help file is also written in Japanese as well.  
I think that it is important to translate English (also Multilingual), not to mention bug fixes.  
Or migrate this library to the latest .NET.
