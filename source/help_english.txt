Organya 2 (Zwei)   Ver2.1.0   Simple Help
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

  Basic usage is the same as "Organya 1" developed by Mr. Pixel.
  I have added variable window size, colored notes,
  changed "Dram" wording to "Drum" wording (laugh),
  released drum objects that weren't released (smile),
  and added lots and lots of functions I wanted for myself.

  The exact same added drum sounds will be used in game
  software that I'm making now.

  Although I didn't really intend to publish,
  Mr. Pixel's occasional guidance in the BBS helped me modify Organya,
  with this dependence on help with anything it has been released.

# File format (2.0.0 and up)

  If you use the new drum sounds in Organya 2, it won't load in Organya 1.
  If you do not select any new drum sounds, it can be read in Organya 1.

 [Track names]
  Melody tracks
    0 ~ 7   => 1 ~ 8
  Drum tracks
    8 ~ 15  => Q ~ I

  When inputting track numbers (for example in Copy), please enter
  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, Q, W, E, R, T, Y, U, or I.


# Export to Standard MIDI Format (2.1.0 and up)

    Making this function was 10 years late! You'll notice it's already the mid
    2010s. The difference between MIDI tracks and channels is where it was
    reborn. Because it's a bonus feature, there are rough places.

    I'm trying the following.

    [COMMON]
    * For now, it uses GM standards. That said, it doesn't insert a GM System On
      message because that only causes restrictions. There should be no problem
      with GS (Roland) or XG (Yamaha), because they're upwardly compatible
      with GM.
    * Extra CC events for operation aren't inserted.
    * The unused first bar is for control changes. Therefore, the sequencer
      measures are shifted by one with respect to Organya measures. To shorten
      the silence at the beginning, the first bar uses a fast tempo.
    * Each Organya track is assigned to a MIDI channel.

    [MELODY]
    * The Program Change value is based on the Organya instrument. (That said,
      you can change it when exporting.)
    * Tone change (RPN) isn't used.
    * The Freq setting is inherited. (Organya reference value is 1000, MIDI
      standard is 16,384.)
    * For Pan values, a CC event is inserted only when the Pan value is
      different than the previous note.
    * Volume values are reflected in the velocity values.
    * Events without a pitch are ignored (not converted).
    * When pipi is specified, the sound will be 2/3 the original length.

    [DRUM]
    * Of course, drums use channel 10. The eight Organya tracks Q to I are
      aggregated into one channel.
    * For drums only, the Pan value is ignored (not converted).
    * Drums are converted into plausible drum sounds. Although it's impossible
      to convert Cat. For cymbals and toms only, the pitch value will cause a
      change in the note number.

    [DIALOG]
    * Enter the number of repeats when exporting.
      You can export a crazy MIDI file size depending on the input value.
      It will insert the author information into the Conductor track.
    * Program Change values can be selected in the dialog.

    After exporting, it is assumed you will modify as appropriate in a MIDI
    sequencer.


# Volume operations (2.1.0 and up)

  Use it when you want to draw a beautiful curve to attenuate the sound.
  It is useless to people who can draw beautiful curves freehand.

  The effect of the operations is slightly different, (1) modifies existing
  events, (2) automatically adds events. For example, in the case of
  linear decay,

  (1) Modify existing events only:
      Note length is not considered. All existing events are affected.

      <<Before operation>>                => <<After operation>>

     |O-----------        O-------------    |O-----------        O-------------
     |            O-------                  |            O-------              
  VOL|*           *       *                 |*
     |        *                             |        *
     |                                      |            *
     |                                      |                    *

      Use for fade-outs.

  (2) Automatically add events:
      Note length is considered. Events are added to the entire selection,
      each note is processed individually.

      <<Before operation>>                => <<After operation>>

     |O-----------        O-------------    |O-----------        O-------------
     |            O-------                  |            O-------              
  VOL|*           *       *                 |***         **      ***
     |        *                             |   ***        **       ****
     |                                      |      ***       **         ***
     |                                      |         ***      **          ****

      I wanted to add this feature.
      Internally, it first adds events to the entire selection,
      then calls (1) on each note.


# Emphasize noteheads when zoomed out (2.1.0 and up)

  @ When unchecked:
      When you zoom out, the notehead is reduced.

  @ When checked:
      When you zoom out, the notehead is increased up to 16 pixels.


# Slightly slide the y coordinate of the notes in each track (2.1.0 and up)

  By shifting the notes of each track by about 1 pixel, you can see when the
  notes of another track are behind the notes of the current track.

  Menu + select range         Select in measure units

  Alt + select range          Select in beat units


# Feature Description

  [Stretch to n times]
  Extend the interval and length of the notes. Adjustment of repeat position is
  not preformed. Use if you ever want to use a triplet in the middle.

  [Shorten 1/n times]
  Reverse the above operation.
  Notes not in the position of a multiple of n are removed.

  * Current track ~ If the selection range is selected on
    a drum track, changes only the notes included in the range.

  [Open in your own dialog] (Caution!!)
  The common dialog mechanism does not want to save the window size on its own
  Anyway, because it's annoying to look for files as I (for work) make a large
  number of files in one folder and the small window size remains, this function
  is attached in order to increase the size and keep it. And to properly hook a
  message to the common dialog, initialization is the number of times called
  instead of the contents of the message because the decision is pretty risky
  I think. (May depend on the environment)

  [The target is always the current track]
  This is also a special feature.
  When the track changes, the selection will be changed to the current track
  automatically. In addition, "select all tracks" is interpreted as follows:
    * Current track 1 ~ 8 => Only select melody tracks.
    * Current track Q ~ I => Only select drum tracks.
  Use when you want to copy and paste melody line and drum line separately.


# Range selection operator
  The base measure is the measure located on the LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN.
  Clear the range by right-clicking.
  Will be selected in units of beats when you check "~ in units of the grid."

  I think this operator is intuitive.
    * This function is mostly for my own use.


[]Export to wav format
    Was going to do, but was derailed. Not enough patience.
    Whether you use LPDIRECTSOUNDCAPTUREBUFFER,
    configure an event for the playback position of PRIMARYBUFFER
    to regularly issue a NOTIFY event, or copy the buffer completely,
    it's troublesome any way.


[]Pan and Volume headers light up when you click on them.
    They only light up in version 2.1.0. It has no significance.
    Clicking Select toggles the "Always Select Current Track" function.

# Limitations

  In dual screen (multi-monitor) environments, the music notation is not drawn
  beyond an area the size of the main monitor.
  Once you enlarge the window and restart, it will draw to the second screen.
  ...Because the function that returns the size of the virtual display is not
  supported by VC++ 6.0, it is a last resort.

  The playing keyboard has limited polyphony.
  Occasionally, audio will keep sounding.

  Characters allowed in the file name are limited to what the char type can
  handle: ASCII and Shift_JIS. You can use the third and forth level kanji
  that are specified in Shift_JIS. However, without Unicode, you can't use
  other strange characters and symbols.
  I would handle if you specify the appropriate string manipulation functions
  and file manipulation functions to change type char to wchar_t.

This is Amaya of Studio Pixel.

In the studio, an earlier composition software that doesn't use a MIDI
sound source, called "PiyoPiyo", had been used to make things. With that
referred to as the first publicly available tool, slight issues came up
during its use and after.

Based on it, from August 1999 through now, finally the next work "Organya"
is complete. Previously the strength, I decided to compromise PiyoPiyo's
additional expression system (although pale in sound).

Basically an internal development tool, and not very general, occasionally
people who say "I like the pale sound for some reason" and even "I want to
compose that sound" call this tool perfect.
